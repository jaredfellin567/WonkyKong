# WONKY KONG

**Wonky Kong** is a 2D platformer game written in C++ using OpenGL and FreeGLUT. Built for UCLA’s CS curriculum, the game is inspired by Donkey Kong and features object-oriented architecture, collision detection, and real-time game logic.

## 🎮 GAME DESCRIPTION

In Wonky Kong, the player navigates platforms, jumps over obstacles, and avoids enemies to reach the top of the level. The game runs on a tick-based loop (20 ticks per second), processing keyboard input, updating object positions, handling collisions, and rendering the screen.

## 🛠 REQUIREMENTS

- macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported)
- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- FreeGLUT (`brew install freeglut` on macOS)
- OpenGL (usually pre-installed)
